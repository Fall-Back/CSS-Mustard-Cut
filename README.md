CSS Only Mustard Cut
====================

Cutting the Mustard without Javascript.

Read the SitePoint article: http://www.sitepoint.com/cutting-the-mustard-with-css-media-queries/

I hope to keep this repo up to date with any new 'cuts' or related techniques as and when they're developed or suggested.

Please raise issues or any problems, ideas or 'cuts'.

CSS Only Mustard Cut
====================

Cutting the Mustard without Javascript.

Read the [SitePoint article](http://www.sitepoint.com/cutting-the-mustard-with-css-media-queries/).

I hope to keep this repo up to date with any new 'cuts' or related techniques as and when they're developed or suggested.

Please raise issues for any problems, ideas or 'cuts'.

The Original Cut
----------------
~~~
<!--
    IE 9+, FF 8+, Opera 12, Chrome 29+, Android ~4.4+
    Chrome 29+, Opera 16+, Safari 6.1+, iOS 7+, Android ~4.4+
->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-stylesheet.css" media="
    only screen and (min-resolution: 0.1dpcm),
    only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-color-index:0)
">

The M3 Cut (Much More Modern)
-----------------------------

~~~
<!--
    Print (Edge doesn't apply to print otherwise)
    IE 10, 11
    Edge
    Chrome 29+, Opera 16+, Safari 6.1+, iOS 7+, Android ~4.4+
    FF 29+
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-stylesheet.css" media="
    only print,
    only all and (-ms-high-contrast: none), only all and (-ms-high-contrast: active),
    only all and (pointer: fine), only all and (pointer: coarse), only all and (pointer: none),
    only all and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-color-index:0),
    only all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: 3e1dpcm)
">

[Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#compare=ie+10,firefox+29,chrome+29,safari+6.1,opera+16,ios_saf+7.0-7.1,android+4.4) (Yay, Flexbox!)

[Test page](http://fall-back.github.io/test/support-m3.html)

To remove IE 10 and 11 support, remove the 2nd line (`only all and (-ms-high-contrast: none), only all and (-ms-high-contrast: active),`).

<s>Note that if you're combining the links media queries into one I tried putting in line breaks to make it more readable, but this cause IE9 to ignore the query and apply the styles, so DON'T ADD LINE BREAKS.</s>
 - For some reason I can't recreate the above. Something else may have been the cause of this problem.


The EM2 Cut (Even More Modern)
------------------------------

~~~
<!--
    Print (Edge doesn't apply to print otherwise)
    Edge, Chrome 39+, Opera 26+, Safari 9+, iOS 9+, Android ~5+*, Android UCBrowser 11.8+**
    FF 47+

    *  (according to caniuse, though it works on ~4.3+ if using Chrome or Samsung)
    ** (according to caniuse though currently untested. Does not work on Android UCBrowser 11.3.2)
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-stylesheet.css" media="
    only print,
    only all and (pointer: fine), only all and (pointer: coarse), only all and (pointer: none),
    only all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (display-mode:browser), (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (display-mode:fullscreen)
">

Note the Android versions aren't certain because it actually depends on the WebKit version that's being used. For example, I've seen the styles actually work on an Android 4.3 device (emulated) because it was using a modern enough version of WebKit. So far, I've been unable to determine at exactly which version support starts but it appears to be somewhere between 535.19 and 537.36. It's complicated.

Mix and Match
-------------

For clarity, you can mix and match the queries for more customised support.

Print
~~~
only print
~~~


IE 9+, FF 8+, Opera 12, Chrome 29+, Android ~4.4+
~~~
only screen and (min-resolution: 0.1dpcm)
~~~


Chrome 29+, Opera 16+, Safari 6.1+, iOS 7+, Android ~4.4+
~~~
only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-color-index:0)
~~~


IE 10, 11
~~~
only all and (-ms-high-contrast: none), only all and (-ms-high-contrast: active)
~~~

Edge, Chrome 39+, Opera 26+, Safari 9+, iOS 9+, Android ~5+*, Android UCBrowser 11.8+**
*  (according to caniuse, though it works on ~4.3+ if using Chrome or Samsung)
** (according to caniuse though currently untested. Does not work on Android UCBrowser 11.3.2)
~~~
only all and (pointer: fine), only all and (pointer: coarse), only all and (pointer: none)
~~~


FF 29+
~~~
only all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: 3e1dpcm)
~~~


FF 47+
~~~
only all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (display-mode:browser), (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (display-mode:fullscreen)
~~~


UCBrowser (JS user-agent sniff*)
~~~
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('UCBrowser') > -1) {
  var link  = document.createElement('link');
  link.rel  = 'stylesheet';
  link.href = 'your-stylesheet.css';
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(link);
  // You may also want to add a class to be able to target these browsers in CSS:
  document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].className += ' ucbrowser';
}
~~~


Opera Mini (JS user-agent sniff*)
~~~
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Opera Mini') > -1 || navigator.userAgent.indexOf('OPiOS') > -1) {
  var link  = document.createElement('link');
  link.rel  = 'stylesheet';
  link.href = 'your-stylesheet.css';
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(link);
}
~~~

*So far as I'm aware it's not possible to disable JS in UCBrowser or Opera Mini, so if the 'sniffs' are placed in HTML rather than an external file, things aren't likely to go wrong.


IE8 (uses conditional comments)
~~~
<!--[if IE 8]>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-stylesheet.css">
<![endif]-->
~~~
